# Tic Tac Toe: Marvel vs DC edition

The project is a spin off the traditional Tic Tac Toe game with a 3 x 3 game board. Instead of having X and O battle it out, you have Marvel vs DC characters, with their own unique symbols.

Feel free to test out my project [here](https://jeffreyquan.github.io/project0-tictactoe/).

### Motivation

The aim for this project was to deliver a working 2-player Tic Tac Toe game that could be hosted online with the following requirements:

* render a game board in the browser
* switch turns between X and O
* visually display which side has won

This was my first project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course at Sydney.

### Technologies

* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* [Animate](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) - a CSS add on with a bunch of cool animations

### Key Features

* **Character selection**: being able to select Marvel and DC characters using a selection panel. One player chooses a Marvel character and the other must choose a DC character.
* **Unique symbols**: symbols unique to the characters themselves, instead of X and O. So, you'll see Captain America's famous shield and the Superman logo.

See the further development section below of additional features I will be adding.

### Learnings
* DOM manipulation
* Object and array manipulation, including when nested
* Creating hover and animation effects

### Further Development
I'm aiming to add the following features to the game:
* **AI:** adding a one-player mode where the user can play against an AI.
* **Mobile Responsive**: updating the interface to be able to play on mobile devices.
